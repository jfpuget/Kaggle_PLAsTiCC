Notebooks should be executed in that order:

* `test_chunks.ipynb`  Splits test data into chunks and stores them.
* `base_features_006_filter_error_6_std.ipynb`  Base features used for lightgbm models.
* `bazin_003.ipynb` Fits Bazin curves for all extra galactic sources.


These notebooks aren't used for the competition solutions, but they contain pretty graphics:
* `eda_031_celerite.ipynb` Fits gaussian process, generates curves from it, and display them.
* `eda_024_bazin.ipynb`  Fits and displays Bazin curves.
* `eda_026_newling.ipynb` Fits and displays Newling curves.
